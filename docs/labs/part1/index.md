# Part 1: Building from Scratch

Start with an empty repo and full control. Learn the spec-first discipline that transforms how you work with AI coding assistants.

---

## The Friday Demo Challenge

You just got this message from your PM:

> *"We're pitching to investors on Friday. Can you build a working checkout flow by then? Needs to handle payments and track orders. Oh, and it has to be compliant."*

This part simulates that week. By the end, you'll have production-ready code you'd confidently demo.

---

## What You'll Build

| Day | What Happens | Outcome |
|:----|:-------------|:--------|
| **Day 1 Morning** | Experience AI without specs, then learn the spec-first approach | Understand why specifications matter |
| **Day 1 Afternoon** | Research, plan, and implement your first feature | Working payment endpoint |
| **Day 2 Morning** | Add a second feature using the same discipline | Order service with state machine |
| **Day 2 Afternoon** | Integrate features and ship | Production-ready checkout system |

## About Timing Estimates

Lab timing varies based on several factors:

| Factor | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|
| **AI Model** | Claude, GPT-4, GPT-4o have different generation speeds |
| **Task Type** | Spec/clarify are fast (1-5 min), implement is slow (30-120 min) |
| **System** | Codespaces, local machine, network latency |
| **Your Workflow** | Reading code, experimenting, debugging |

**Timing ranges include buffer for experimentation.** If you finish a core task early:
- Deepen understanding of generated artifacts
- Try bonus experiments in each lab
- Explore alternative approaches
- Help fellow learners

{: .note }
> **The goal is mastery, not speed.** Take the time you need. Implementation-heavy labs (1.3, 1.5) are inherently variable -- that's normal.

## Prerequisites

Before starting Part 1, complete the [Prerequisites](../../prerequisites.html) to ensure:
- GitHub Codespaces environment is ready
- AI assistant (GitHub Copilot recommended) is configured
- You can create files using agentic mode
