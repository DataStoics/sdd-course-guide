# The Friday Demo Challenge

You just got this message from your PM:

> *"We're pitching to investors on Friday. Can you build a working checkout flow by then? Needs to handle payments and track orders. Oh, and it has to be compliant."*

This course simulates that week. By the end, you'll have production-ready code you'd confidently demo.

## Day 1: Spec Monday â†’ Build Tuesday

**The Setup:** Experience what happens without specs, then learn the better way.

| Time | Lab | What You'll Build |
|:-----|:----|:------------------|
| Morning | [ðŸ”¥ Contrast Exercise](contrast-exercise) | 30 min of chaos â€” AI coding without guidance |
| Morning | [ðŸ“‹ Lab 1.1: Init and Spec](lab-1.1-init-and-spec) | Your first governance-ready specification |
| Afternoon | [ðŸ”¬ Lab 1.2: Research and Plan](lab-1.2-research-and-plan) | Technology decisions with trade-off docs |
| Afternoon | [ðŸ› ï¸ Lab 1.3: Implementation](lab-1.3-implementation) | Working payment endpoint with tests |

**Day 1 Outcome:** Payment service that handles idempotency and passes security scan.

## Day 2: Wednesday Changes â†’ Thursday Demo-Ready

**The Plot Twist:** Your PM wants order tracking too. With specs, it's manageable.

| Time | Lab | What You'll Build |
|:-----|:----|:------------------|
| Morning | [ðŸ“‹ Lab 1.4: Order Spec](lab-1.4-order-spec) | Second feature spec with state machine |
| Afternoon | [ðŸ”— Lab 1.5: Integration](lab-1.5-integration) | Full checkout flow: order â†’ payment â†’ confirmation |
| Afternoon | [ðŸš€ Lab 1.6: Production](lab-1.6-production) | Docker, CI/CD, final security check |

**Day 2 Outcome:** Complete checkout system ready for the Friday investor demo.
