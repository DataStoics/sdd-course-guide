# Choose Your AI Assistant

SDD works with any AI coding assistant. Pick the one you're most comfortable with.

{: .important }
> **All three produce similar results with good specs.** The spec is the primary driver of code quality, not the AI tool.

## Supported Assistants

| Assistant | Best For | Setup Complexity |
|:----------|:---------|:-----------------|
| [GitHub Copilot](copilot) | VS Code users, enterprise teams | Low |
| [Claude Code](claude) | Complex reasoning, long context | Medium |
| [Gemini CLI](gemini) | Command-line workflows, Google Cloud | Medium |

## Why Tool Choice Matters Less Than You Think

In traditional AI-assisted coding, the choice of AI dramatically affects output quality. Different models have different strengths.

**With SDD, this changes.** When you provide:
- Clear governance constraints
- Explicit acceptance criteria
- Structured requirements

...any capable AI produces compliant, testable code. The spec does the heavy lifting.

> During the labs, you can switch assistants between exercises to compare. The code should be nearly identical.
