# SDD Foundations Course 1
{: .fs-9 }

Same AI. Better specs. Production-ready code.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

A 2-day hands-on course where you'll build a checkout system that's ready to ship - not ready to rewrite.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

[Get Started](setup){: .btn .btn-primary .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 }
[View Labs](labs/){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 }

## The Spec Makes the Difference

The same AI produces wildly different results depending on what you give it.

### Without a Spec (Vague Prompt)

> "Build me a payment endpoint"

You get:
- Missing error handling
- No input validation
- Hardcoded values everywhere
- Security vulnerabilities
- Works on demo, fails in production

### With a Robust Spec

> "Process payments per spec: validate amount > 0, use gateway tokenization, return standardized errors, log without PAN, handle timeout with retry"

You get:
- Complete error scenarios covered
- Input validation built-in
- Configurable and testable
- Security by design
- Production-ready from the start

**The AI didn't get smarter. The spec got better.**

## What You'll Experience

| Day | The Shift |
|:----|:----------|
| **Day 1 AM** | Frustration: AI produces inconsistent code |
| **Day 1 PM** | Clarity: Your first real spec changes everything |
| **Day 2 AM** | Confidence: Adding features without breaking things |
| **Day 2 PM** | Pride: Code you'd actually ship |

By Friday, you'll demo a working checkout system to stakeholders.
