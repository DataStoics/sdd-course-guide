## The Problem

AI coding assistants are powerful but inconsistent. Without guidance, they produce code that:

- Works differently each time
- Misses compliance requirements
- Needs extensive rework
- Can't be trusted for production

**This course fixes that.**

---

## What You'll Build

A complete checkout system with:

| Component | Governance |
|:----------|:-----------|
| Payment processing | PCI DSS tokenization |
| Order management | GDPR-compliant audit trail |
| Integration tests | 80%+ coverage |
| Production container | Security scan passing |

All built with AI, guided by specifications.

## The Journey

| Day | You'll Experience |
|:----|:------------------|
| **Day 1 AM** | The chaos of AI coding without specs |
| **Day 1 PM** | Your first governance-ready specification |
| **Day 2 AM** | Adding features without breaking things |
| **Day 2 PM** | Production-ready code you'd demo to investors |

**[Start with Labs â†’](labs/)**
