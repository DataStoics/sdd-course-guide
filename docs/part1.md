# Part 1: Building from Scratch

Start with an empty repo and full control. Learn the spec-first discipline that transforms how you work with AI coding assistants.

---

## The Friday Demo Challenge

You just got this message from your PM:

> *"We're pitching to investors on Friday. Can you build a working checkout flow by then? Needs to handle payments and track orders. Oh, and it has to be compliant."*

This part simulates that week. By the end, you'll have production-ready code you'd confidently demo.

## What You'll Build

| Day | What Happens | Outcome |
|:----|:-------------|:--------|
| **Day 1 Morning** | Experience AI without specs, then learn the spec-first approach | Understand why specifications matter |
| **Day 1 Afternoon** | Research, plan, and implement your first feature | Working payment endpoint |
| **Day 2 Morning** | Add a second feature using the same discipline | Order service with state machine |
| **Day 2 Afternoon** | Integrate features and ship | Production-ready checkout system |
