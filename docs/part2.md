# Part 2: Transforming Legacy Code

{: .note }
> **Coming Soon** — Most real-world work isn't greenfield. Part 2 tackles the hard stuff.

---

## What's Different About Brownfield?

| Part 1: Building from Scratch | Part 2: Transforming Legacy Code |
|:------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
| Empty repository | 5,000+ lines of existing code |
| You write the spec | You **extract** the spec |
| Full technology control | Tech debt constrains choices |
| Build compliance in | Retrofit compliance |

---

## What You'll Learn

- **Reverse Specification**: Extract implicit specs from working code
- **Strangler Fig Pattern**: Incrementally replace legacy with spec-compliant code
- **External System Integration**: Connect to Jira, Confluence, GitHub via Model Context Protocol
- **Spec Extraction Workflows**: Turn undocumented systems into governed codebases

---

## The Challenge

You inherit a legacy monolith with:
- No documentation
- Implicit business rules buried in code
- Technical debt accumulated over years
- Compliance requirements that weren't considered originally

Your mission: Extract specifications, then modernize systematically.

---

The spec-first discipline you learned in Part 1 becomes **spec-extraction** thinking in Part 2.

> Complete [Part 1: Building from Scratch](/part1/) first. The greenfield discipline is prerequisite knowledge.
