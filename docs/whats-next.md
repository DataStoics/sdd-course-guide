# What's Next

Congratulations! You've completed Spec-Driven Development Foundations Course 1.

---

## What You Accomplished

In two days, you transformed a vague PM request into production-ready software:

| Day | What You Built | The Skill |
|-----|----------------|-----------|
| **Day 1 Morning** | Experienced AI without specs (Lab 0) | Understood the problem |
| **Day 1 Morning** | First governance-ready specification | Spec-first thinking |
| **Day 1 Afternoon** | Technology decisions with trade-offs | Explicit planning |
| **Day 1 Afternoon** | Working payment endpoint with tests | Implementation from spec |
| **Day 2 Morning** | Order service with state machine | Second feature spec |
| **Day 2 Afternoon** | Integrated checkout flow | Cross-feature integration |
| **Day 2 Afternoon** | Production container, CI/CD pipeline | Ship-ready artifact |

**You now have:**
- A repeatable specification workflow
- Experience with spec-kit commands
- A working checkout system you'd confidently demo
- The ability to apply this to any AI coding assistant

---

## Apply It This Week

The best way to solidify these skills:

1. **Pick a real feature** at work (something small)
2. **Write the spec first** (30-60 minutes)
3. **Have AI implement from the spec**
4. **Compare** the result to your usual AI coding
5. **Note the differences** in quality, rework, and review time

> Skills stick when you use them immediately. Don't wait for the "perfect" project.

## Quick Reference Card

Keep this handy as you apply Spec-Driven Development:

### spec-kit Commands

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `specify init .` | Initialize project | Start of new project |
| `/speckit.constitution` | Define project principles | Before first feature |
| `/speckit.specify` | Generate spec from description | New feature request |
| `/speckit.clarify` | Resolve ambiguities | After initial spec |
| `/speckit.plan` | Create technical plan | Before implementation |
| `/speckit.implement` | Generate code from spec | When spec is complete |
| `/speckit.checklist` | Validate completeness | Before code review |

### The "Would I Demo This?" Test

Before shipping, ask:
- [ ] Is this secure? (Can I prove it?)
- [ ] What happens on double-click? (Idempotent?)
- [ ] What happens on error? (Graceful?)
- [ ] Where's the audit trail? (Traceable?)
- [ ] Would I confidently demo this to investors?

## Course 2: Brownfield Legacy Flow

Most real-world work isn't greenfield. You inherit legacy systems with implicit requirements, undocumented business logic, and technical debt.

| Course 1 (Greenfield) | Course 2 (Brownfield) |
|:----------------------|:----------------------|
| Empty repository | 5,000+ lines of existing code |
| You write the spec | You **extract** the spec |
| Full control | Constraints everywhere |
| Build compliance in | Retrofit compliance |

### What You'll Learn

- **Reverse Specification**: Extract implicit specs from working code
- **Strangler Fig Pattern**: Incrementally replace legacy with spec-compliant code
- **External System Integration**: Connect to Jira, Confluence, GitHub via Model Context Protocol

## Thank You

You invested time and effort to learn a better way of building software with AI. That investment will pay dividends across your career.

**Remember**: The spec is the contract. AI implements it. You validate and demo.

Now go build something greatspec-first.
