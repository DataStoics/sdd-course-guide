# What's Next

Congratulations! You've completed Spec-Driven Development Foundations Course 1.

You can now build compliant software from scratch using the spec-first methodology. But the learning doesn't stop here.

## Course 2: Brownfield Legacy Flow

Most real-world work isn't greenfield. You inherit legacy systems with implicit requirements, undocumented business logic, and technical debt.

### The Challenge Difference

| Course 1 (Greenfield) | Course 2 (Brownfield) |
|:----------------------|:----------------------|
| Empty repository | 5,000+ lines of existing code |
| You write the spec | You **extract** the spec |
| Full control | Constraints everywhere |
| Build compliance in | Retrofit compliance |
| Monday spec  Friday ship | Understand first, then improve |

### What You'll Learn

| Module | Skill |
|--------|-------|
| **Reverse Specification** | Extract implicit specs from working code using AI analysis |
| **Strangler Fig Pattern** | Incrementally replace legacy with spec-compliant code |
| **Compliance Remediation** | Find and fix governance gaps in existing systems |
| **Risk-Based Refactoring** | Prioritize fixes based on business impact |
| **External System Integration** | Connect to Jira, Confluence, GitHub via MCP |

### Enterprise Tools You'll Use

| System | Course 2 Purpose |
|--------|------------------|
| **Context7** | Get current library docs for legacy dependencies |
| **Perplexity** | Research CVEs, migration paths, compatibility issues |
| **GitHub MCP** | Analyze existing codebase, PR history, issues |
| **Confluence** | Query company architecture decision records |
| **Jira** | Pull requirements from existing tickets |

**Express interest**: [training@datastoics.io](mailto:training@datastoics.io) with subject "Course 2 Interest"

## Enterprise Training Options

### Team Workshops

Bring Spec-Driven Development to your organization:

| Format | Duration | Team Size | Includes |
|--------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Virtual Workshop** | 2 days | 8-20 developers | Live instruction, custom scenarios |
| **On-Site Intensive** | 3 days | 10-30 developers | Hands-on labs with your codebase |
| **Champion Training** | 1 week | 2-4 leads | Train-the-trainer, curriculum materials |

### Custom Curriculum

We can adapt the course for your:
- **Tech stack**: Python, Java, TypeScript, Go
- **Compliance requirements**: PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR
- **Tools**: Your existing CI/CD, code review, project management

**Contact**: [enterprise@datastoics.io](mailto:enterprise@datastoics.io)

## Apply It This Week

The best way to solidify these skills:

1. **Pick a real feature** at work (something small)
2. **Write the spec first** (30-60 minutes)
3. **Have AI implement from the spec**
4. **Compare** the result to your usual AI coding
5. **Note the differences** in quality, rework, and review time

{: .tip }
> Skills stick when you use them immediately. Don't wait for the "perfect" project.

## Quick Reference Card

Keep this handy as you apply Spec-Driven Development:

### spec-kit Commands

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `specify init .` | Initialize project | Start of new project |
| `/speckit.constitution` | Define project principles | Before first feature |
| `/speckit.specify` | Generate spec from description | New feature request |
| `/speckit.clarify` | Resolve ambiguities | After initial spec |
| `/speckit.plan` | Create technical plan | Before implementation |
| `/speckit.implement` | Generate code from spec | When spec is complete |
| `/speckit.checklist` | Validate completeness | Before code review |

### The "Would I Demo This?" Test

Before shipping, ask:
- [ ] Is this secure? (Can I prove it?)
- [ ] What happens on double-click? (Idempotent?)
- [ ] What happens on error? (Graceful?)
- [ ] Where's the audit trail? (Traceable?)
- [ ] Would I confidently demo this to investors?

## Thank You

You invested time and effort to learn a better way of building software with AI. That investment will pay dividends across your career.

**Remember**: The spec is the contract. AI implements it. You validate and demo.

Now go build something greatspec-first.
