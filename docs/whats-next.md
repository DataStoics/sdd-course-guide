# What's Next: Beyond Greenfield

You've completed Course 1. You can now build compliant software from scratch using SDD.

**But what about existing code?**

---

## The Brownfield Challenge

Most real-world work isn't greenfield. You inherit:

- Legacy systems with implicit requirements
- Undocumented business logic
- Technical debt and compliance gaps
- Code that "just works" (until it doesn't)

**Course 2 addresses this.**

---

## Course 2: Brownfield Legacy Flow

| Course 1 (Greenfield) | Course 2 (Brownfield) |
|:----------------------|:----------------------|
| Empty repository | 5,000+ lines of existing code |
| You write the spec | You extract the spec |
| Full control | Constraints everywhere |
| Build compliance in | Retrofit compliance |

### What You'll Learn

1. **Reverse Specification** â€” Extract implicit specs from working code
2. **Strangler Fig Pattern** â€” Incrementally replace legacy with SDD-compliant code
3. **Compliance Remediation** â€” Find and fix governance gaps in existing systems
4. **Risk-Based Refactoring** â€” Prioritize what to fix based on business impact

## Applying SDD at Work

### Start Small

Don't try to convert your entire codebase. Pick one new feature and:

1. Write the spec first
2. Get team buy-in on the approach
3. Measure the difference (rework, review cycles, defects)
4. Share results

### Build the Habit

The SDD workflow becomes natural:

\\\
New feature request arrives
    â†“
Write spec (30 min)
    â†“
Review spec with stakeholders
    â†“
AI implements from spec
    â†“
Tests pass, security scan clean
    â†“
Ship with confidence
\\\

### Scale to Team

Once you've proven the approach:

1. Create team spec templates
2. Add spec review to PR process
3. Train team members (use this course!)
4. Measure aggregate metrics
